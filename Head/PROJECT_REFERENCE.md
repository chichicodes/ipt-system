# IPT System - Project Reference & Rebuild Plan

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Name:** Industrial Training Practical (IPT) System
**Purpose:** Platform for managing Industrial Practical Training, connecting students, supervisors, and institutions
**Technology Stack:** PHP (Backend), Tailwind CSS (Frontend), MySQL (Database)
**Architecture:** Multi-role web application with secure authentication and data management

---

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY ANALYSIS

### User Roles Identified
1. **Institute Administrator** - System management, user oversight, reporting
2. **Student** - Profile management, application submission, report submission
3. **Academic Supervisor** - Student oversight, feedback provision, evaluation
4. **Industrial Supervisor** - Practical training supervision, evaluation, scheduling

### Current Database Schema (27 Tables)
- **Core Tables:** users, admins, students, supervisors, applications, reports
- **Data Tables:** personal_details, academic_qualification, contact_details
- **Feature Tables:** evaluations, feedback, notifications, security_logs
- **System Tables:** sessions, cache, migrations, training_areas

### Key Data Flows
1. **Authentication:** Multi-role login → Session management → Role-based access
2. **Application Process:** Student application → Admin review → Supervisor assignment
3. **Reporting:** Student reports → Supervisor feedback → Evaluation
4. **Communication:** Notifications → Email alerts → Status updates

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### What's Working
- Database structure is comprehensive and well-designed
- Basic admin authentication exists
- Tailwind CSS is partially integrated
- Core file structure is established

### Major Issues Found
- Inconsistent file includes and paths
- Session management bugs ($lifetime variable)
- Mixed CSS frameworks (Bootstrap + Tailwind conflicts)
- Authentication system partially broken
- Database queries referencing non-existent columns
- Layout functions not properly defined

### Security Concerns
- Session security warnings
- Undefined variables in security-critical code
- Mixed authentication patterns

   - User management (CRUD)
   - Application processing
   - System monitoring

2. **Data management**
   - Search and filtering
   - Pagination
   - Bulk operations
   - Export functionality

### Phase 4: Student Portal (Week 4)
1. **Student registration and profile**
   - Multi-step registration
   - Profile management
   - Document uploads

2. **Application system**
   - Training application forms
   - Status tracking
   - Document management

### Phase 5: Supervisor Portals (Week 5)
1. **Academic supervisor features**
   - Student assignment
   - Report review
   - Evaluation system

2. **Industrial supervisor features**
   - Practical supervision
   - Visit scheduling
   - Performance assessment

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Week 6)
1. **System integration**
   - Cross-role workflows
   - Notification system
   - Communication features

2. **Quality assurance**
   - Unit testing
   - Security testing
   - User acceptance testing
