Execution Plan for Industrial Training Practical System
Assuming the Institute Administrator role is already implemented, this plan outlines the steps to implement the remaining user roles (Student, Academic Supervisor, and Industrial Supervisor) using PHP for the backend and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

1. Prioritize User Roles

Next Role: Student  
Reason: Central to the system, enabling core workflows like form submissions and feedback.


Subsequent Roles:  
Academic Supervisor  
Industrial Supervisor




2. Implement Student Role
Features and Order of Implementation

Registration and Login/Logout  

Adapt existing Institute Administrator authentication code.  
Create student-specific registration form with fields (e.g., name, email, student ID).  
Implement secure login/logout using PHP sessions.


View Profile  

Display student details (e.g., name, ID, contact info) retrieved from the database.  
Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout.


Fill and Submit Application Form  

Design a form for placement applications (e.g., preferences, training period).  
Add client-side validation (JavaScript) and server-side validation (PHP).  
Store data in the database.


Fill and Submit Reports  

Create forms for daily/weekly reports (e.g., date, activities, challenges).  
Allow draft saving and final submission.  
Store reports in the database using PHP.


View Feedback  

Display supervisor feedback on submitted reports.  
Use Tailwind CSS for a structured feedback view.


View & Print Application Letter  

Generate a downloadable PDF letter based on approved application data.  
Provide view/download options using PHP.



Technical Details

Frontend: Tailwind CSS for responsive, consistent UI.  
Backend: PHP for authentication, form handling, and database interactions.  
Database: Extend schema for student profiles, applications, reports, and feedback.  
Security: Sanitize inputs, prevent SQL injection using prepared statements.


3. Implement Academic Supervisor Role
Features

Registration and Login/Logout  
Reuse authentication logic with role-specific access.


Search Student Details  
Search students by name, ID, or placement.  
Display details, applications, and reports.


Give Feedback  
View student reports and submit feedback.  
Store feedback in the database.


Make Evaluation  
Evaluate student performance based on reports.  
Save evaluations for final assessments.



Technical Details

Frontend: Tailwind CSS for search and feedback interfaces.  
Backend: PHP for search queries, feedback, and evaluation logic.  
Database: Add tables for feedback and evaluations.


4. Implement Industrial Supervisor Role
Features

Registration and Login/Logout  
Adapt existing authentication code.


Give Feedback  
View and comment on assigned students’ reports.


Make Evaluation  
Evaluate student performance.


Update Visitation Schedules  
Create/update schedules and share with relevant users.



Technical Details

Frontend: Tailwind CSS for schedule management UI.  
Backend: PHP for schedule updates and notifications.  
Database: Add visitation schedule tables.


5. Enhance Institute Administrator Role

Additional Features:  
Integrate with new roles (e.g., assign placements, generate reports).  
Update student details or application statuses if needed.


Technical Details:  
Frontend: Tailwind CSS for dashboards.  
Backend: PHP for user management and reporting.  
Database: Ensure compatibility with new data.




6. Testing and Quality Assurance

Unit Testing: Test individual features (e.g., form submission, data display).  
Integration Testing: Verify workflows (e.g., report submission to feedback).  
User Testing: Ensure usability and functionality.  
Security Testing: Protect against vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).


7. Project Management

Task Breakdown: Split features into tasks (e.g., UI design, backend logic).  
Version Control: Use Git for tracking changes.  
Documentation: Document code, schema, and user guides.


2. General System Requirements





Develop a notification system to alert users of key actions (e.g., report submission, feedback received, schedule updates) using PHP for backend logic and Tailwind CSS for a notification dashboard UI.



Implement scheduled database backups using PHP scripts or MySQL tools.

3. Student Role





Fill and Submit Application Form: Add functionality to display application status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected) in the student profile view using PHP and Tailwind CSS.



Fill and Submit Reports: Allow students to edit saved draft reports before final submission.

4. Academic Supervisor Role





Registration: Implement logic to assign Academic Supervisors to students or placements during registration or via Institute Administrator.



Give Feedback: Notify supervisors of new student assignments or report submissions via the notification system.

5. Industrial Supervisor Role





Registration: Implement logic to assign Industrial Supervisors to students or placements during registration or via Institute Administrator.



Give Feedback: Notify supervisors of new student assignments or report submissions via the notification system.

6. Enhance Institute Administrator Role





Develop bulk import functionality for adding students and supervisors via CSV using PHP.



Implement audit logging for administrative actions (e.g., user updates, placements) in a database audit table.



Verify integration of new roles with existing Administrator features (e.g., placement assignments, report generation).

7. Testing and Quality Assurance





Test frontend UI for compatibility across major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) using Tailwind CSS.



Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative users (e.g., students, supervisors) to validate functionality.



Optimize database queries with indexing and implement pagination for search results using PHP.

8. Project Management





Define milestones: Student role (2–3 weeks), Academic Supervisor (1–2 weeks), Industrial Supervisor (1–2 weeks), Testing (1 week).



Document internal PHP endpoints for key features (e.g., report submission) to support future integrations.

9. Technical Details

Add CAPTCHA (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) to registration forms for all roles using PHP to prevent
